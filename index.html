    <!-- # Going on a tangent --><p>You ever write a regular expression and then wonder how the heck it determine its matches? how does it go from such a terse syntax like <code>f[o]*</code> to a little machine that determines "YES, we're a match" or "NO, but oh well, there's more fish in the sea".</p><p>Well I did, and I found a particularly nice algorithm for determining if a regular expression matches a given input string! The two reasons I chose this algorithm are:</p><ol><li>It's very simple to understand, and the code expressing it is very short.</li><li>It relies on the concept of the <code>derivative</code> of a regular expression, which I didn't even know existed.</li></ol><pre><code class="clojure">    (defn regex-match
    [pattern data] 
    (if (empty? data)
        (regex-empty? (regex-empty pattern))
        (regex-match (derivative pattern (first data)) (rest data))))
</code></pre><p>The algorithm is simple to state:</p><ol><li>if the current string we're matching is empty (written $\epsilon$), and the regular expression we want to match against matches the empty string, then $s$ matches the regex $R$! Otherwise, it does not match.</li><li>If the string is non-empty, then we perform two replacements + run again:
<ul><li>the current string is replaced by the the current string without the first character (ex: $blue \rightarrow lue$)</li><li>the current regex is replaced by the <strong>derivative</strong> of $R$ with respect to the first character in $s$ (ex: $R \rightarrow D_b(R)$, since $b$ is the first character in $blue$).</li></ul></li></ol><p>Ok, so what's this mysterious derivative?</p><p>In short: it is the regular expression that matches the same stuff as $R$, assuming that a given character (ex: $b$) has <strong>already been matched</strong> by $R$. You can think of it as the "tail" of the regular expression.</p><h2 id="primer-on-regular-expressions">Primer on regular expressions</h2><p>Given:</p><ul><li>a string $s$ to match, say "blue"</li><li>a regular expression $R$ that will compute a match, say $b(l|o)u(e|t)(s)*$
<ul><li>recall: the $|$ operator is alternation (aka "choice"), and $*$ is iteration. The above regex could match $bout$, $blue$, $blot$, $boue$, as well as all of these variations ending in ANY number of $s$'s (ex: $bluessssssss$).</li><li>In addition to all those operations, we are doing one other sneaky one: concatenating several regexes together to form $R$! The characters $b$, $l$, $o$, $u$, $e$, $t$ are each very simple regexes that ONLY match that one character, and we can concat them together to form a regex that matches the first thing, then the second thing, then the third thing, etc.!</li></ul></li></ul><p>then we want to determine if $s$ is recognized by $R$. To do this, we can slightly more formally define $R$ as representing the <strong>set of all the strings</strong> (drawn from a particular alphabet) <strong>that it matches</strong>:
$$R := \{  t | \text{ $R$ matches t and } t \in \Sigma \}$$</p><h3 id="example-where-sigma--abcdez-and-the-regular-expression-is-blouets">Example (where $\Sigma = {a,b,c,d,e,...,z}$) and the regular expression is $b(l|o)u(e|t)(s)*$:</h3><p>$$
b(l|o)u(e|t)(s)* = \{
bout, blue, blot, boue, bouts, blues, blots, boues, boutss, bluess, blotss, bouess, boutsss, bluesss, blotsss, bouesss, ...
\}
$$</p><p>We will also need a notion of the <strong>empty</strong> regex $\empty$, which is the regex that matches nothing:</p><p>$$
\empty := \text{the empty set, confusingly also written } \empty
$$</p><p>This is <strong>NOT THE SAME THING</strong> from the regex that matches the empty string $\epsilon$. This regular expression is also written as $\epsilon$:</p><p>$$
\epsilon := \{ \epsilon \}
$$</p><h2 id="the-brzozowski-derivative">The Brzozowski derivative</h2><p>With this more concrete definition of a regex, then the <strong>Brzozowski derivative</strong> of $R$ with respect to a character $a$ is</p><p>$$
D_a(R) := \{\text{ } b \text{ } | \text{ } ab \in R \text{ }\}
$$</p><p>In other words, it is the regex that matches everything $R$ would have if $a$ had already been matched.</p><p>To compute this, Brzozowski came up with a recursive way of expressing $D_a(R)$:</p><p>$$D_a(\empty) = \empty$$
$$D_a(\epsilon) = \empty$$
$$D_a(a) = \epsilon $$
$$D_a(a') = \empty \text{ if } a \neq a' $$
$$D_a(R_1 R_2) = δ(R_1) D_a(R_2) \text{ }  | \text{ } D_a(R_1) \text{ }  R_2 $$
$$D_a(R_1 \text{ } | \text{ }  R_2) = D_a(R_1)\text{ } | \text{ } D_a(R_2)$$
$$D_a(R*) = D_a(R) R*$$</p><p>Note that the "product" rule also uses a function $\delta$. This function is a helper, and it just determines if its argument accepts the empty string pattern $\epsilon$. If it doesn't, then it returns the null pattern $\empty$:</p><p>$$\delta(\empty) = \empty$$
$$\delta(\epsilon) = \epsilon$$
$$\delta(a) = \empty$$
$$\delta(R_1 R_2) = \delta(R_1)\delta(R_2)$$
$$\delta(R_1 \text{ } | \text{ } R_2) =\delta(R_1) \text{ } | \text{ } \delta(R_2) $$
$$\delta(R *) = \epsilon$$</p><p>This is a lot of rules, and they are best understood through some examples, so let's get on with that.</p><hr /><h3 id="example-r--dogt-s--dog">Example: $R = do(g|t)$, $s = dog$</h3><p>Let's try and compute $D_d(R)$ to get a feel for how to apply the rules above.</p><p>First we have to apply the product rule, since we have a concatenation of 3 regexes.</p><p>$$
D_d(do(g|t)) = \delta(d) D_d(o(g|t)) \text{ } | \text{ } D_d(d) \text{ }  (o(g|t))
$$</p><p>The RHS of the alternation is the more imporant piece, so let's tackle that first:</p><p>$$
D_d(d) \text{ }  (o(g|t)) = \epsilon \text{ } (o(g|t)) = o(g|t)
$$</p><p>On the LHS of the |:</p><p>$$
\delta(d) D_d(o(g|t)) \text{ } = \empty \text{ } D_d(o(g|t)) = \empty
$$</p><p>because <strong>NO</strong> strings are accepted by $\empty$, so if it appears at the beginning of a concatenation like it does here, it overrules any matches that may have happened in the rest of the regex.</p><p>Putting the LHS + RHS together, we find that</p><p>$$
D_d(do(g|t)) = o(g|t) \text{ } | \text{ } \empty = o(g|t)
$$</p><p>This is exactly the <em>subset</em> of strings in the set represented by $do(g|t)$
that are suffixes of $d$!</p><hr /><h2 id="why-is-this-thing-called-a-derivative">Why is this thing called a derivative?</h2><p>Every sufficiently nice function can be approximated by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a>, and in some cases, the function is <em>exactly</em> equal to its infinite Taylor series.</p><p>In other words, the function's derivatives carry information about the original function, and bundling them together
in the above sense represents the behavior of the function.</p><p>$$
f(a) \approx \sum_{ n=0 }^\infty \text{ (n-th derivative of f at a) } * g(x, a, n)
$$
where $g(x, a, n)$ is some function g that depends on $x,a,n$.</p><p>In his <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/321239.321249">original 1964 paper</a>, Brzozowski showed that every regular expression has a similar representation in terms of its derivatives. <strong>Note:</strong> his notation for alternation is $+$, so
when you look at the following, read the sums as alternations of regexes.</p><p>$$
\text{Every regular expression R can be written as  } R = \delta(R) + \sum_{ a \in \Sigma } aD_a(R)
$$</p><p>This is sort of like an analogue of Taylor's theorem, but for regexes! A regex is "approximated" in the above sense by its derivatives. They give subsets of the total set of matches that the regex $R$ yields, and as you add more and more of those together via $|$, you gather enough options to eventually reconstruct the original regex.</p><p>In fact, he shows that over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, every regex $R$ only has <strong>finitely many unique derivatives $d_R$</strong>. He terms these $R$'s <em>characteristic derivatives</em>. So, most of the terms in the above representation can be ignored. If we want, we can express $R$ purely in terms of an alternation of its characteristic derivatives.</p><h2 id="back-to-the-algorithm">Back to the algorithm</h2><p>With the above intution in hand, we can understand a little better why the matching algorithm works. If a regular expression is represented by its derivatives and we iteratively apply the derivative to $R$ (w.r.t. the current character we are looking at in the string $s$), then we should be construcing a descending chain of subsets ($S_1 \subseteq S2 \subseteq S3 \subseteq ... $) of strings in our alphabet $\Sigma$, which should end in an empty set <strong>exactly</strong> when we run out of characters in $s$.</p><p>I ported <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/implementation-of-regular-expression-matching-in-scheme-with-derivatives/">Matt Might's implementation</a> to Clojure <a href="https://github.com/cantwellnc/parsing-with-derivatives">here</a>, and it works pretty well! I'd highly recommend going and playing with that code to get a feel for how the parsing algorithm works.</p><p>The performance of the naive implementation is not great, but it is a truly beautiful and simple algorithm to understand once you get what the Brzozowski derivative does to a regex.</p><h2 id="more">More</h2><ul><li>In the original paper, he defines the derivative for <strong>any</strong> boolean connective $f(P,Q)$, not just alternation. The value of $\delta$ on $f$ might be more complicated to derive, but it is possible in terms of other basic connectives. He gives many examples of what f could be: intersection, set complement, xor, etc.</li><li>The original paper also goes into how to construct state machines that accept strings from $R$ using its characteristic derivatives. If you want more info on how this works, I'll probably be writing a follow-up post on how this works too.</li></ul>
