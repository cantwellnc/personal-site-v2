## Announcement 

This is going to be where I write some stuff down that I like. 

Planned content for the next couple months: 
- The decorator pattern, its relationship to higher-order functions, and how to use this to compose/manipulate predicates. 
- Porting the concept of :fn specs from [clojure.spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) to hypothesis.
- Persistent data structures + structural sharing (i.e. how to make programming with immutable data structures efficient)
