I currently work as a Software Engineer at Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, where I build automation for data ingestion, replication, and warehousing. 

Before that, I worked in the Enterprise Data Office at the Vanguard Group. I worked on creating an automated pipeline for provisioning Generative AI projects. I also created and maintained novel MLOps infrastructure for all the machine learning at Vanguard!

Work technologies: 
- Python 
- AWS 

Fun Technologies: 
- Clojure!!
- Lisps in general.
- Actually understanding recursion (thank you, The Little Schemer).

I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill in May of 2019 with a B.S. in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. I'm constantly exploring new ways of looking at the world around me, learning as much as I can as I go.

I really like functional programming + try to apply it at work to simplify my code + keep my PR reviewers happy. 

I also enjoy learning new languages and experimenting with computer-generated art.

When I'm not working or doing some fun programming quest, you can find me at the climbing gym or on some outdoor adventures. Previously, I worked as a routesetter at Progression Climbing and Fitness in Chapel Hill, NC. One day, I'd like to develop some software that would positively impact the climbing industry (ahem...looking at you, RockGymPro).
