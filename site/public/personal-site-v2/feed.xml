When we recieve a file, the application code wants to look at these configuration files that map file names to various processing steps + metadata about the files, determine the correct configuration to use, and apply the required transformations to the data. The legacy code that figures out what configuration to apply uses regular expressions to match the incoming file name to a particular configuration name. Simple, right?</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://cantwellnc.github.io/personal-site-v2/personal-site-v2/posts-output/2024-01-12/</guid><link>http://cantwellnc.github.io/personal-site-v2/personal-site-v2/posts-output/2024-01-12/</link><title>Questions in Questions</title><description>When someone asks a true/false question like "Is this book any good?", it is almost never atomic; it can usually be broken down into subquestions.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://cantwellnc.github.io/personal-site-v2/personal-site-v2/posts-output/2024-01-09/</guid><link>http://cantwellnc.github.io/personal-site-v2/personal-site-v2/posts-output/2024-01-09/</link><title>First blog post!</title><description>AnnouncementThis is going to be where I write some stuff down that I like.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
